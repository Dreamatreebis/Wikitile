Plans for a construction with removable floor/ceiling/wall panels using the Wikihouse WREN system. The construction will serve as a testing area for electronical research. It consists of seven 'modules'. 

I will use this program to get familiar with the Finite Element Analysis. The software I have access to, is commercial. 

If other structural elements of the Wikihouse (Blackbird) need to be analysed, this skill might come in handy. To be able to share all information, I must choose an open source FEM package. Can anybody advise  open source FEM software for constructional purposes?
